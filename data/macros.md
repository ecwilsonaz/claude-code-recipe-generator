## Hitting the Targets

### Protein (~55g per serving)

| Option | Amount | Protein |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Chicken thigh + 3 eggs | 5 oz + 3 eggs | 35g + 18g = 53g |
| Chicken thigh + 2 eggs | 6 oz + 2 eggs | 42g + 12g = 54g |
| Salmon + 2 eggs | 6 oz + 2 eggs | 40g + 12g = 52g |
| Salmon | 8 oz | 53g |
| Beef + 2 eggs | 5 oz + 2 eggs | 35g + 12g = 47g |
| Turkey + 3 eggs | 5 oz + 3 eggs | 35g + 18g = 53g |

### Fat (~65g per serving)

| Source | Amount | Fat |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Olive oil | 3 tbsp | 42g |
| Olive oil | 4 tbsp | 56g |
| Chicken thigh (skin-on) | 5 oz | 14g |
| Salmon | 6 oz | 22g |
| Eggs | 3 large | 15g |
| Macadamia nuts | 1 oz | 21g |

**Typical breakdown:** 3 tbsp olive oil (42g) + protein fat (15-22g) = 57-64g ✓

### Net Carbs (~20g per serving)

Net carbs come almost entirely from vegetables. No need to track separately if hitting vegetable/fiber targets.

| Vegetable | Amount | Net Carbs | Fiber |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Broccoli | 1 cup | 4g | 5g |
| Brussels sprouts | 1 cup | 5g | 4g |
| Green beans | 1 cup | 4g | 4g |
| Zucchini | 1 cup | 3g | 2g |
| Carrots (cooked) | 1 cup | 9g | 4g |
| Bok choy | 1 cup | 1g | 1g |
| Bell peppers | 1 cup | 6g | 2g |

### Fiber (~15g per serving)

Target 2.5-3 cups cooked vegetables per serving:

| Combo | Amount | Fiber | Net Carbs |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Broccoli + Brussels sprouts | 1.5c + 1c | 12g | 11g |
| Broccoli + green beans + zucchini | 1c + 1c + 1c | 11g | 11g |
| Brussels sprouts + carrots + bok choy | 1.5c + 0.5c + 1c | 9g | 13g |

**To hit 15g fiber:** Add extra vegetables or include higher-fiber options like broccoli and Brussels sprouts. A generous 3 cups of mixed vegetables typically hits 12-15g.
