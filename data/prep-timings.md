# Prep Timings Profile

Timing adjustments for recipe estimates based on cooking experience and cognitive style.

---

## Current Profile: ADHD + Moderate Experience

**Cooking skill:** Moderate — comfortable with most techniques, owns decent equipment, knows where things are

**Cognitive style:** ADHD — executive function challenges, task-switching costs, variable focus, time blindness

**Philosophy:** Realistic estimates that account for how cooking actually works, not aspirational chef times

---

## Time Types

Recipes involve two types of time — distinguish them for better planning:

| Type | Description | ADHD Impact |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Active time** | Hands-on work requiring attention | Harder; causes fatigue |
| **Passive time** | Waiting while something happens (thawing, roasting, simmering) | Easier; can rest or do other tasks |

A recipe with 20 min active + 40 min passive is easier than 40 min active + 20 min passive, even though both total 60 min.

---

## Setup Phase

Before any actual cooking begins:

| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Read recipe completely | 5 min | Actually process it, not skim |
| Gather ingredients from fridge/pantry | 5-7 min | Check you have everything; substitution decisions |
| Gather equipment (pans, bowls, tools) | 4-5 min | Cutting board, knives, sheet pans, measuring tools |
| Clear and clean workspace | 3-5 min | ADHD kitchens need this step |
| **Setup total** | **17-22 min** | Often underestimated or omitted from recipe times |

---

## Protein Prep Timings

**CRITICAL: Prep protein last. Don't let it sit after cutting.**

### Thawing (Passive Time)

| Method | Time | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Cold water thaw (chicken thighs, 1 lb) | 20-30 min | Change water every 10 min for faster thaw |
| Cold water thaw (salmon fillet, 6-8 oz) | 15-20 min | Thinner = faster |
| Cold water thaw (ground beef/turkey, 1 lb) | 20-25 min | |
| Microwave thaw | 5-8 min | Works but can partially cook edges |

**Planning note:** Start thaw first, do vegetable prep during thaw time.

### Active Protein Prep

| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Unwrap protein | 1 min | |
| Pat VERY dry (critical for browning) | 4 min | Multiple paper towels, both sides, be thorough |
| Cut chicken thighs into pieces | 5-6 min | Slippery, requires attention, uneven shapes |
| Slice chicken breast thin | 5-6 min | Partial freezing helps; requires focus |
| Portion salmon into fillets | 3-4 min | Easier than chicken |
| Season protein (salt + spices) | 2 min | |
| Crack and prep eggs (3 eggs) | 2 min | Crack, check for shells, whisk if needed |
| **Typical protein prep total** | **12-18 min active** | Plus thaw time |

---

## Vegetable Prep Timings

Vegetables can be prepped first and can sit. Target: 2.5-3 cups per serving.

| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Washing** | | |
| Wash 2-3 types of vegetables | 3-4 min | Rinse, dry, inspect |
| | | |
| **Broccoli** | | |
| Cut into florets (2 cups) | 5-6 min | Separate florets, trim stems, even sizes |
| | | |
| **Brussels sprouts** | | |
| Trim and halve (2 cups) | 6-7 min | Tedious; remove outer leaves, trim stem, halve |
| | | |
| **Cauliflower** | | |
| Cut into florets (2 cups) | 5-6 min | Similar to broccoli |
| | | |
| **Zucchini** | | |
| Slice into rounds or half-moons (2 cups) | 4 min | Quick and easy |
| Cut into chunks | 5 min | |
| Spiralize into noodles | 6-8 min | If you have a spiralizer |
| | | |
| **Green beans** | | |
| Trim ends and cut (2 cups) | 5-6 min | Snap or cut ends, cut to size |
| | | |
| **Bell peppers** | | |
| Core, seed, slice/dice (1-2 peppers) | 5-6 min | Remove core and seeds, then cut |
| | | |
| **Carrots** | | |
| Peel and slice (1 cup) | 5-6 min | Peeling adds time |
| Peel and dice | 7-8 min | More cuts |
| | | |
| **Bok choy** | | |
| Separate, wash, slice (2 cups) | 4-5 min | Separate leaves, wash thoroughly, slice |
| | | |
| **Cabbage** | | |
| Core and slice thin (2 cups) | 5-6 min | Remove core, slice into ribbons |
| | | |
| **Kale** | | |
| Strip leaves, chop (2 cups) | 5-6 min | Remove tough stems, tear or chop |
| | | |
| **Cucumbers** | | |
| Slice (1 cup) | 3 min | Easy |
| | | |
| **Radishes** | | |
| Trim and slice thin (1 cup) | 4 min | Trim ends, slice |

**For a typical meal (2-3 vegetable types, ~3 cups total):** Budget **15-20 minutes** vegetable prep.

## Aromatics & Flavor Builders

| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Ginger** | | |
| Cut piece, peel, mince (1 tbsp) | 5-6 min | Peeling is fiddly (use spoon edge); mincing awkward shape |
| Grate with microplane (1 tbsp) | 4 min | Faster than mincing but still need to peel |
| | | |
| **Scallion greens** | | |
| Separate, slice thin (1 bunch) | 3-4 min | Discard white parts, slice greens |
| | | |
| **Fresh herbs** | | |
| Pick leaves and mince (¼ cup) | 4-5 min | Strip leaves from stems, bunch, mince |
| Rough chop for garnish | 3 min | Less precise |
| | | |
| **Citrus zest** | | |
| Zest 1 lemon or lime | 3 min | Find microplane, zest avoiding pith, measure |
| | | |
| **Dry spices** | | |
| Measure 3-4 spices | 4-5 min | Find jars, measure each, return jars |
| | | |
| **Garlic-infused oil** | | |
| Already made (grab from fridge) | 1 min | Ideal — make ahead |
| Make fresh | 20-25 min | Heat, infuse, cool, strain — not same-day task |

## Cooking Timings (Adjustments from Recipe)

| Cooking Task | Recipe Says | ADHD Adjustment | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Searing protein** | X min per side | +1-2 min | Easy to miss the "golden brown" moment |
| **Searing in batches** | Listed time | +3-4 min | Batch management requires executive function |
| **Stir-frying** | 5-8 min | +3-4 min | High attention, things happen fast, easy to overcook |
| **Simmering** | Listed time | Same | Set timer, walk away — ADHD-friendly |
| **Roasting (oven)** | Listed time | Same | Set timer, hands-off — ADHD-friendly |
| **Pressure cooker** | Listed time | Same | Very ADHD-friendly — set and forget |
| **"Until fragrant" (30-60 sec)** | Listed time | +30 sec | Easy to miss or get distracted |
| **"Until golden"** | Listed time | +1-2 min | Subjective cue requires attention |
| **Deglazing and making pan sauce** | 3-5 min | +2 min | Multiple steps, checking consistency |
| **Resting protein** | Listed time | Same | Passive; set timer |

---

## Transition Costs (The Task-Switching Tax)

ADHD brains pay extra time when switching between tasks. Build these in:

| Transition | Time |
|------------|------|
| Setup → Starting prep | 2-3 min |
| Finishing prep → Starting cooking | 3-4 min |
| Between active pans/tasks | 2 min |
| Checking recipe mid-cook | 1-2 min |
| "Where did I put that?" | 2-3 min |
| Tasting, adjusting seasoning | 2 min |
| Plating and serving | 3-5 min |

---

## Histamine-Aware Sequencing

The order matters for this diet:

| Phase | What to Do | Time |
|-------|------------|------|
| 1. Setup | Gather everything, clear space | 15-20 min |
| 2. Start thaw | Protein in cold water | 1 min active, 20-30 min passive |
| 3. Vegetable prep | Wash, cut all vegetables | 15-20 min |
| 4. Aromatics prep | Ginger, scallions, herbs, zest | 8-12 min |
| 5. Sauce/spice prep | Measure spices, mix any sauces | 5 min |
| 6. Protein prep | Remove from water, dry, cut, season | 12-18 min |
| 7. Cook | Immediately after protein prep | Varies |
| 8. Serve/freeze | Eat immediately or freeze portions | 5-10 min |

**Key:** Protein prep (step 6) happens last, right before cooking. No sitting.

## Complete Time Calculation

### Formula

```
Total Time = Setup + Prep (active) + Passive + Transitions + Cooking + Buffer

Where:
- Setup: 15-20 min (gathering, reading, clearing)
- Prep: Sum of tasks using times above
- Passive: Thawing, roasting, simmering (can overlap with active)
- Transitions: 10-15 min total (distributed throughout)
- Cooking: Recipe time + ADHD adjustments
- Buffer: 5 min (things never go exactly to plan)
```

### Example Calculation

**Recipe claims:** "Prep: 15 min, Cook: 20 min, Total: 35 min"

**Actual breakdown:**

| Phase | Claimed | Realistic |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Setup (read, gather, clear) | (not listed) | 18 min |
| Thaw protein | (not listed) | 25 min passive |
| Vegetable prep (3 cups) | 8 min | 18 min |
| Aromatics (ginger, scallions, spices) | 5 min | 12 min |
| Protein prep | 2 min | 14 min |
| Transitions | (not listed) | 10 min |
| Cooking | 20 min | 24 min |
| Plating | (not listed) | 4 min |
| Buffer | (not listed) | 5 min |
| **Total active time** | **35 min** | **~75 min** |

**However:** 25 min of thaw time overlaps with vegetable/aromatics prep, so:

**Realistic wall-clock time: ~60-65 min**

This isn't failure — it's accurate planning.

## Recipe Complexity Tiers

| Tier | Active Time | Total Time | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Quick** | <30 min | <45 min | Few ingredients, one-pan, simple techniques |
| **Standard** | 30-45 min | 45-70 min | Multiple components, moderate prep |
| **Involved** | 45-60 min | 70-90 min | More technique, more components |
| **Project** | 60+ min | 90+ min | Complex techniques, special occasion |

**Default to Quick or Standard for weeknights.**

## What Makes a Recipe ADHD-Friendly

### Good (seek these out)

- One-pan or sheet-pan meals
- Set-and-forget steps (roasting, pressure cooker, simmering)
- Prep can be completed before any cooking starts
- Clear sensory cues ("until fragrant," "until edges are golden")
- Forgiving timing (braises, roasts)
- Fewer than 10 ingredients
- Single protein, 2-3 vegetables

### Challenging (save for good days)

- Multiple things finishing simultaneously
- Precise timing windows ("exactly 90 seconds")
- Multiple active pans at once
- Last-minute assembly with many components
- Techniques requiring constant attention (risotto, delicate sauces)
- "While X is cooking, do Y, Z, and W"

## Strategies That Help

| Strategy | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Full mise en place** | Reduces task-switching during cooking |
| **Timer for everything** | External cues beat time blindness |
| **One active pan max** | Less juggling |
| **Batch similar tasks** | All chopping, then all measuring, then cook |
| **Background audio** | Music/podcast helps maintain focus on repetitive tasks |
| **Clean as you go** | Less visual clutter = less cognitive load |
| **Prep during passive time** | Use thaw/roast/simmer time for other prep |
| **Written checklist** | Check off steps; helps track progress |
