## The Four Elements of Good Cooking

Adapted from Samin Nosrat's *Salt Fat Acid Heat* framework — these four elements, properly balanced, make food taste delicious.

### Salt
- **Enhances flavor** — salt makes food taste more like itself
- **Season in layers** — protein before cooking, vegetables during, adjust at end
- **Different salts for different uses:** fine sea salt for seasoning, flaky salt (Maldon) for finishing
- **Under-seasoning is the #1 home cooking mistake** — taste constantly and adjust

### Fat
- **Carries flavor** — fat-soluble compounds from spices and aromatics infuse into oil
- **Creates texture** — enables browning, crispiness, richness
- **Quality matters** — good olive oil tastes better than cheap olive oil
- **For APOE4:** Extra virgin olive oil is the primary fat; use ghee and coconut oil sparingly

### Acid
- **Brightens and balances** — acid lifts flavors and cuts through richness
- **Add at the end** — a finishing squeeze or zest wakes up a dish
- **For low-histamine (no vinegar):** Use lemon zest, lime zest, sumac, or citrus juice if tolerated

### Heat
- **Controls texture** — high heat for crispy; low heat for tender
- **Develops flavor** — browning (Maillard reaction) creates complexity
- **Know your equipment** — induction responds faster than gas; adjust accordingly

## Mise en Place: Preparation Is Everything

**Mise en place** ("everything in its place") is especially critical for this diet — histamine builds in cut/exposed protein, so you need to move efficiently from prep to plate.

### Before You Start
- Read the entire recipe
- Gather all ingredients
- Complete all prep (chopping, measuring, mixing sauces)
- Arrange in order of use

### Histamine-Aware Prep Sequence
1. **Prep vegetables first** — they can sit
2. **Make sauces/dressings** — set aside
3. **Prep protein last** — cut it, season it, cook it immediately
4. **Never let cut protein sit** — from package to pan to plate

### Induction Stovetop Notes
- Heats faster than gas — pans get hot quickly
- Responds instantly to temperature changes — good for precise control
- Only works with magnetic cookware (stainless steel, some non-stick)
- No heat when pan is removed — useful for temperature control

## Building Flavor Without Onion and Garlic

The biggest challenge for low-FODMAP cooking is replacing the aromatic base that onion and garlic provide. Here's how:

### The Substitutes

| Forbidden | Replacement | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Garlic | Garlic-infused olive oil | FODMAPs don't transfer to oil; use generously at start of cooking |
| Onion | Scallion greens, chives, leek greens, fennel | Green parts only; white parts are high FODMAP |
| Shallots | Chives + pinch of asafoetida (optional) | Asafoetida mimics allium flavor (use sparingly, check tolerance) |

### Building an Aromatic Base

**Classic (forbidden):** Sauté onion and garlic in oil until softened.

**Low-FODMAP version:**
1. Heat garlic-infused olive oil over medium heat
2. Add fresh ginger (grated or minced) — sizzle 30 seconds
3. Add scallion greens, sliced — cook 1 minute
4. Add dried spices — bloom 30 seconds
5. Proceed with recipe

**Depth without alliums:**
- Fresh ginger — warmth and brightness
- Lemongrass — aromatic complexity (Thai-inspired)
- Fennel — subtle sweetness (Mediterranean)
- Celery — savory background note
- Fresh herbs (hardy) — rosemary, thyme added early

## Acid Without Vinegar

All vinegars are fermented and avoided. Here's how to get brightness:

| Acid Source | Flavor Profile | Best For |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Lemon zest** | Bright, floral | Fish, chicken, vegetables, finishing |
| **Lime zest** | Sharp, tropical | Asian-inspired, Mexican-inspired |
| **Lemon/lime juice** | More intense acid (test tolerance) | Dressings, marinades, finishing |
| **Sumac** | Tangy, fruity | Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, finishing |
| **Tomato** | Acidic + umami | — **AVOID** (histamine) |

### Technique
- Add acid at the **end** of cooking — heat dulls bright notes
- Start with zest (milder); add juice if tolerated
- Sumac can be used as both seasoning and finishing

## The Science of Browning

### Why Browning Matters
The Maillard reaction (browning) creates hundreds of flavor compounds that don't exist in raw or steamed food. It's the difference between "good" and "delicious."

### Requirements for Browning
1. **Dry surface** — moisture = steam = no browning. Pat proteins VERY dry with paper towels.
2. **Hot pan** — 300°F+ for Maillard reaction. Pan should be fully preheated.
3. **Don't crowd** — overcrowding traps steam. Cook in batches if needed.
4. **Don't move** — let it sit. Flip once. Movement = no crust development.
5. **Fat** — thin layer of oil helps conduct heat evenly to surface

### The Sear Protocol
1. Remove protein from fridge, unwrap, pat very dry
2. Season with salt (can be done just before cooking — see dry-brine section for advance seasoning)
3. Heat pan over medium-high until very hot (2-3 minutes)
4. Add oil, let it shimmer (but not smoke)
5. Place protein in pan — you should hear an aggressive sizzle
6. **Don't touch it** for 3-4 minutes
7. Flip when it releases easily and is golden-brown
8. Repeat on other side

### Fond: Liquid Gold
The brown bits stuck to the pan after searing are called **fond** — they're concentrated flavor.

- **Deglaze** with broth, water, or coconut aminos (not wine — fermented)
- Scrape up all the bits as liquid simmers
- Reduce to make a pan sauce
- Never waste the fond — it's the best part

## Dry-Brining: Better Than Wet Brine

Dry-brining (salting in advance) is the single biggest improvement you can make to proteins. It seasons deeply, improves texture, and enhances browning.

### How It Works
1. Salt draws moisture to surface
2. Salt dissolves in moisture
3. Salty liquid is reabsorbed into meat
4. Result: seasoned throughout, not just on surface

### Method
- **Chicken thighs/breasts:** Salt generously, refrigerate uncovered 1-24 hours
- **Salmon:** Salt 30-45 minutes before cooking (no longer — texture changes)
- **Beef:** Salt generously, refrigerate uncovered 1-24 hours

### Histamine Note
This seems to contradict "don't let protein sit" — here's the distinction:
- **Dry-brining in fridge, uncovered** = safe. Cold, dry air inhibits bacteria.
- **Cut protein sitting at room temp** = histamine risk. Avoid.

If concerned, skip dry-brining and salt just before cooking — food will still be good, just less deeply seasoned.

## Cooking Proteins: Techniques by Cut

### Chicken Thighs (Skin-On)

**Goal:** Crispy skin, juicy meat.

1. Pat very dry, especially skin
2. Score skin lightly if thick (helps render fat)
3. Start **skin-side down in cold or low-heat pan** — this renders fat slowly
4. Cook on medium-low 12-15 minutes — skin should be golden and crispy
5. Flip, cook 5-7 minutes until 175°F internal
6. Rest 5 minutes

### Salmon

**Goal:** Crispy skin, medium-rare to medium center.

1. Pat very dry
2. Salt 30-45 minutes ahead (optional) or just before
3. Heat pan over medium-high, add oil
4. Place skin-side down, press gently to ensure contact
5. Cook 4-5 minutes without moving — skin will crisp
6. Flip, cook 2-3 minutes for medium (125-130°F internal)
7. Rest 2-3 minutes

### Beef (Steak or Thick Cut)

**Standard sear:**
1. Pat very dry
2. Dry-brine 1-24 hours (or salt just before)
3. Sear over high heat 3-4 minutes per side
4. Rest 5-10 minutes

**Reverse sear (for thick cuts 1.5"+):**
1. Season, place on wire rack over sheet pan
2. Bake at 250°F until 10-15°F below target temp (use thermometer)
3. Rest while heating skillet to ripping hot
4. Sear 1-2 minutes per side for crust
5. No additional rest needed

### Eggs

**Fried (crispy edges):**
1. Heat non-stick over medium-high
2. Add olive oil or ghee generously
3. Crack eggs in, season with salt
4. Let cook until whites are set, edges crispy
5. Optional: baste with pan fat for set yolk top

**Scrambled (soft curds):**
1. Whisk eggs with pinch of salt
2. Heat non-stick over medium-low
3. Add ghee or olive oil
4. Add eggs, let sit 20 seconds
5. Gently push from edges to center, creating curds
6. Remove while still slightly wet — carryover will finish them

## Cooking Vegetables: Maximizing Flavor

### Roasting (Oven — Avoid in Summer)

**Keys to great roasted vegetables:**
1. **High heat** — 400-425°F minimum
2. **Don't crowd** — single layer, space between pieces
3. **Dry vegetables** — pat dry after washing
4. **Generous oil** — toss thoroughly to coat
5. **Season before roasting** — salt, pepper, spices

| Vegetable | Temp | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|------|-------|
| Broccoli | 425°F | 15-20 min | Cut into even florets |
| Brussels sprouts | 425°F | 20-25 min | Halve for flat browning surface |
| Cauliflower | 425°F | 20-25 min | Florets or steaks |
| Zucchini | 400°F | 15-20 min | Watch for overcooking |
| Carrots | 400°F | 25-30 min | Cut evenly for uniform cooking |
| Green beans | 425°F | 15-18 min | Char spots = good |
| Bell peppers | 425°F | 20-25 min | Cut into strips or chunks |

### Sautéing (Stovetop)

**For quick-cooking vegetables (zucchini, bok choy, greens):**
1. Cut into even pieces
2. Heat pan over medium-high
3. Add oil, let shimmer
4. Add vegetables in single layer
5. Let sit 1-2 minutes for browning, then toss
6. Season and finish

### Stir-Frying (High Heat)

**Keys to good stir-fry:**
1. **Everything prepped before heat goes on** — it moves fast
2. **Wok or large skillet ripping hot**
3. **Small batches** — don't crowd
4. **Aromatics first** — ginger, scallion greens (30 seconds)
5. **Proteins next** — sear and remove
6. **Vegetables by cook time** — longest-cooking first
7. **Sauce last** — add, toss, serve immediately

### Steaming (Gentle)

**For when you want clean flavors:**
1. Boil water in pot with steamer insert
2. Add vegetables, cover
3. Steam until just tender (test frequently)
4. Remove slightly early — carryover continues cooking
5. Season after steaming

### Pressure Cooker / Instant Pot

**Advantages:** Very fast cooking = less histamine development

| Vegetable | Pressure Time | Release |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Broccoli | 0-1 min | Quick release |
| Cauliflower | 1-2 min | Quick release |
| Carrots | 2-4 min | Quick release |
| Brussels sprouts | 2-3 min | Quick release |
| Green beans | 1-2 min | Quick release |

**Note:** "0 minutes" means bring to pressure, then immediately quick release.

## Temperature and Doneness

### Proteins (Internal Temperature)

| Protein | Target | Remove At | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Chicken breast | 165°F | 160°F | Rest 5 min; carryover finishes it |
| Chicken thigh | 175°F | 170°F | More forgiving; can go higher |
| Salmon (medium) | 125-130°F | 120-125°F | Still slightly translucent center |
| Salmon (well) | 140°F | 135°F | Fully opaque |
| Beef (medium-rare) | 130°F | 125°F | Red center |
| Beef (medium) | 140°F | 135°F | Pink center |
| Turkey | 165°F | 160°F | Like chicken breast |

### Resting

Resting allows juices to redistribute. Cutting too soon = juices run out onto cutting board.

| Protein | Rest Time |
|---------|-----------|
| Chicken thighs | 5 minutes |
| Chicken breast | 5 minutes |
| Salmon | 2-3 minutes |
| Beef (steak) | 5-10 minutes |
| Beef (roast) | 15-20 minutes |

**Tent loosely with foil** if concerned about cooling — tight wrapping traps steam and softens crust.

## Debunked: The Room Temperature Myth

**Common advice:** "Let meat come to room temperature before cooking for even cooking."

**Reality (per Kenji López-Alt / Serious Eats):**
- A 1-inch steak sitting out 20 minutes raises internal temp only ~2-3°F
- Not meaningful for even cooking
- Would need 1-2+ hours to equilibrate — food safety concern

**For this diet:** Extra reason to skip it — don't let protein sit at room temperature. Go from fridge to pan.

**What actually helps even cooking:**
- Dry-brining (seasons throughout)
- Reverse sear (for thick cuts)
- Proper resting after cooking

## Texture and Contrast

Great dishes have contrast. Aim for multiple textures and temperatures.

### Texture Pairings

| Contrast | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Crispy + Creamy** | Crispy chicken skin + cauliflower mash |
| **Crispy + Tender** | Seared salmon (crisp skin) + silky flesh |
| **Crunchy + Soft** | Toasted seeds on wilted greens |
| **Charred + Fresh** | Charred vegetables + fresh herb garnish |

### Temperature Pairings

| Contrast | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Hot + Cool** | Warm protein + cool herb sauce |
| **Hot + Room temp** | Seared meat + room temp salsa verde |

### Building a Complete Plate

1. **Protein** — properly cooked, well-seasoned
2. **Vegetables** — at least 2 types or preparations for variety
3. **Fat** — olive oil drizzle, sauce, or built into cooking
4. **Acid** — lemon zest, sumac, fresh squeeze at end
5. **Fresh element** — herbs, raw garnish
6. **Crunch** — seeds, crispy bits, textural contrast

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Not Enough Salt
- Taste constantly, adjust in layers
- No processed foods = no background sodium — you need to add it

### Wet Proteins
- Moisture = steam = no browning
- Always pat dry with paper towels

### Crowding the Pan
- Steam gets trapped, temperature drops
- Cook in batches; give pieces space

### Wrong Heat Level
- Too high: burning outside, raw inside
- Too low: no browning, pale and steamed
- Adjust as you go — it's not set-and-forget

### Not Preheating
- Cold pan = sticking, no sear
- Let pan heat 2-3 minutes on induction before adding oil

### Skipping the Sear
- Even for braised dishes, brown the protein first
- Maillard reaction = flavor

### Overcooking Vegetables
- They should have some bite (unless intentionally soft)
- Check early; remove when slightly underdone
- Carryover applies to vegetables too

### Not Tasting
- Your palate is your best tool
- Taste at every stage and adjust
- Final dish should be balanced without needing additions at table

### Moving Food Too Much
- Flipping constantly = no crust
- Let it sit, let it brown, flip once
