## Seasonality (Pacific Northwest)

**Auto-detect based on current date.**

Prefer in-season produce when available, but year-round staples (broccoli, carrots, cabbage, eggs, chicken) are always fine.

### Seasonal Produce

| Season | Dates | Peak Vegetables |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **Spring** | Mar 1 - May 31 | Bok choy, kale, cabbage, radishes |
| **Summer** | Jun 1 - Aug 31 | Zucchini, bell peppers, green beans, cucumbers, fresh herbs |
| **Fall** | Sep 1 - Nov 30 | Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, carrots |
| **Winter** | Dec 1 - Feb 28 | Brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage, carrots (storage crops) |

### Year-Round Staples (Always OK)

- Carrots
- Cabbage
- Eggs
- Chicken thighs

### Wild Salmon Seasonality

| Type | Peak Fresh | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| King (Chinook) | May - September | Most prized |
| Sockeye | June - August | Bold flavor |
| Coho | August - October | Good value |
| **Frozen wild** | Year-round | Always acceptable |

Fresh wild salmon preferred during peak season; frozen wild is fine year-round.

### Seasonal Cooking Restrictions

| Season | Restriction |
|--------|-------------|
| **Summer (Jun-Aug)** | Avoid oven — too hot indoors. Prefer stovetop, instant pot, no-cook. |
| **All other seasons** | No restrictions |

---

## Spice & Heat Tolerance

- **Heat level:** Medium — enjoy some kick but not painful
- **Bold flavors:** Yes — prefer pronounced seasoning over subtle
- **Aromatic spices:** Love cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, ginger

## Cooking Style Preferences

| Preference | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Complexity** | Simple — fewer than 10 ingredients preferred |

## Batch Cooking & Prep

| Preference | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Vegetable prep** | Happy to wash, chop, and refrigerate vegetables 1-2 days ahead |
| **Protein prep** | Will portion and freeze proteins; thaw same-day in cold water |
| **Sauces/oils** | Will make herb oils, garlic-infused oil, spice blends ahead |
| **Freezer meals** | Open to recipes that freeze well — **must freeze immediately after cooking** (not after refrigerating) due to histamine |
| **Leftovers** | Generally avoid — but will freeze portions immediately if recipe makes extra |

| **Weeknight cooking** | Keep it simple — one-pan preferred |

## Notes

- Prefer recipes where the "hero" is a protein I love (salmon, chicken thighs)
- Enjoy variety — don't want to eat the same thing every day
- Like recipes that look appetizing (care about presentation somewhat)
- Appreciate recipes that teach a technique, not just follow steps
