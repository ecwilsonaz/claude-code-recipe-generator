## Key Substitutions

These substitutions replace forbidden ingredients while maintaining authentic flavors:

| Forbidden | Replacement | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Garlic (whole/minced) | Garlic-infused olive oil | FODMAPs don't transfer to oil; use generously |
| Onion | Scallion greens (green part only), chives, leek greens, fennel | White/root parts are high FODMAP |
| Vinegar | Lemon/lime zest, citrus juice (if tolerated), sumac | Sumac provides tang without fermentation |
| Soy sauce | Coconut aminos | Similar umami, no fermentation |
| Fish sauce | Coconut aminos + pinch of salt | Won't be identical but works |
| Mustard | Mustard powder (dry) + lemon zest | Avoids vinegar in prepared mustard |
| Tomatoes | Roasted red bell peppers (for color/sweetness), beets (for earthiness) | Context-dependent |
