## Format Guidelines for Recipe Generation

1. **Ingredient amounts**: Be precise. Use weight (grams/ounces) for proteins, volume for liquids.

2. **Instructions**: Include sensory cues ("until golden brown," "until fragrant, about 30 seconds").

3. **Timing**: Account for all prep work. If something needs to rest or marinate, include it.

4. **Substitutions**: Always offer at least 2-3 alternatives for main ingredients.

5. **Checkboxes**: Use `- [ ]` format for ingredients and shopping list to allow checking off.

6. **Nutrition**: Calculate based on actual ingredients used, not estimates.

7. **Compliance notes**: Always verify and note dietary compliance at the bottom of nutrition.
